 ----------------------------------------→ time

    •	Delivers software in small but usable pieces, each piece builds on pieces already delivered
    •	Rather than delivers the system as a single delivery, the development and delivery is broken down into increments with each increment delivering part of the required functionality
    •	First increment is often core product
    •	Includes basic requirement
    •	Many supplementary features (knowingly) remain undelivered
    •	A plan of next increment is prepared
    •	Modifications of the first increment
    •	Additional features of the first increment
    •	It is particularly useful when enough staffing is not available for the whole project
    •	Increment can be planned to manage technical risks
    •	Incremental model focuses more on delivery of operation product with each increment
    •	Uses requirements are prioritised and the highest priority requirement are included in early increment
    •	Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen though requirements for later increments can continue to evolve
    •	Customer value can be delivered with each increment & system functionality is available earlier
    •	Early increments can be used as prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments
    •	Low risk of overall project failure
    •	The highest priority system tend to receive the most testing

Merits: 1. Early partial product delivery 2. Easier testing & debugging

Demerits: 1. Requires good planning 2. Integration issues
