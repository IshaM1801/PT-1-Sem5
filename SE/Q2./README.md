Q2 Explain with a diagram spiral process model in detail & the kind of applications they are most suitable for.

Ans: Spiral model is a combination of iterative & waterfall model.
• It provides potential for rapid development of increasingly more complete version of the software.
• Using spiral, software developed in a series of evolutionary release.
• Early iteration release might be on paper prototype.
• Late iteration more complex version of software.
• Divided into framework activities (C.P., M.C, D.).
• Each activity represent one segment.
• Evolutionary process begins in a clockwise direction, beginning at the center.
• First circuit around the spiral might result in development of product specification.
• Subsequently develop a prototype and then progressively more sophisticated version of software.
• Unlike other process models that end when software is delivered.
• It can be adapted to apply throughout the life of software.

Concept Development Project:
• Start at the core and continues for multiple iteration until it is complete.
• If concept is developed into an actual product the process proceeds outward on the spiral.

New Product Development Project:
• New product will evolve through a series of iteration around the spiral.
• Later a circuit around spiral might be used to represent “Product Enhancement Project”.

Product Enhancement Project:
• There are times when the process is dormant or software team not developing new things but change is initiated, process starts at appropriated entry point.
• Spiral model uses prototyping as a risk reduction mechanism but more important enables the developer to apply the prototyping approach at each stage in the evolution of the product.
• It maintains the systematic stepwise approach suggested by the classic life cycle but also incorporates it into an iterative framework activity.

⸻

    •	If risks cannot be resolved project is terminated.

Advantages
→ more flexible to changing requirements
→ risk management is easier

Disadvantages
→ it is difficult to manage development process
→ spiral can run indefinitely
