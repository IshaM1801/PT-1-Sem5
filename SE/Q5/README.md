Q5. Discuss prototype model with merits & demerits

         ↑ quick plan

communication → quick design → prototype construction → delivery & feedback → communication

    •	Best approach when –
    •	Objectives defined by customer are general but does not have details like input, processing & output requirements
    •	Developers want to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm, or the form that human-machine interaction should take
    •	Can be used as standalone process model
    •	This model assists the customer to better understand what is to be built when requirements are fuzzy
    •	Prototyping starts with communication flow → customers and software engineers to define overall objectives, identify requirement and make a boundary
    •	Going ahead, planned quickly and modeling occurs
    •	Quick design lead to prototype construction
    •	Prototype is deployed and evaluated by the customer/ user
    •	Feedback from customer/end user will refine requirement and that is how iteration occurs during prototype to satisfy the needs of the user
    •	Prototype can be served as the first system
    •	Both customer & developers like the prototyping paradigm

→ customer/end user get a feel for the actual system
→ developers get to build something immediately

Demerit – 1. Incomplete requirements understanding 2. Scope creep
Frequent changes and feedback can lead to uncontrolled growth in project scope, delaying project delivery.
Customers may only focus on what they see in the prototype and may not consider overall system requirements

Merit – 1. Better Requirement Understanding
Helps clarify user requirements when they are vague/ not well understood at the beginning 2. Early feedback from user
User can interact with a working prototype early, which help gather useful information, feedback and reduce misunderstanding.
