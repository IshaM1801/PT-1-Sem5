# Data Discretization and Concept Hierarchy Generation

## Data Discretization

- Data discretization is a process that reduces the number of values for a given continuous attribute by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals.
- The intervals are labeled with interval labels and can then be used to replace the actual data values.
- This process is necessary when handling continuous-valued attributes in data mining.
- It helps improve the efficiency of mining algorithms and makes the mining results more interpretable.

## Concept Hierarchy Generation

- Concept hierarchies organize attributes or attribute values into multiple levels of abstraction.
- They allow data mining to be performed at multiple granularity levels.
- Lower-level concepts are replaced by higher-level concepts through generalization.
- Concept hierarchies can be defined explicitly by domain experts or generated automatically from the data.

## Methods for Data Discretization

### 1. Binning

- Sort the values and partition them into a number of bins.
- Bins can be equal-width or equal-frequency.
- Values within a bin are smoothed by bin mean, median, or boundaries.

### 2. Histogram Analysis

- Partition the values of an attribute into intervals based on frequency distribution.
- Each interval corresponds to a bin.

### 3. Cluster Analysis

- Group values into clusters using clustering algorithms.
- Values in the same cluster are assigned to the same interval.

### 4. Decision Tree Analysis

- Supervised method that splits the attribute values recursively according to a decision tree model.

## Generation of Concept Hierarchies

### Schema-based Generation

- Partial or total ordering of attributes specified in the schema.
- Explicit specification of concept hierarchies in the schema definition.

### Data-driven Generation

- Analysis of the number of distinct values per attribute.
- Automatic grouping or merging of attribute values to form hierarchies.
- Example: Grouping cities into regions, regions into countries.

## Advantages

- Reduces data size, thus improving efficiency.
- Enables mining at multiple levels of abstraction.
- Improves understandability of results.

**Example:**  
For an attribute _Age_, instead of using exact values (e.g., 23, 27, 35), discretization can produce ranges (e.g., 20–29, 30–39), and concept hierarchy can further generalize these to labels like _Young Adult_ or _Middle Aged_.
