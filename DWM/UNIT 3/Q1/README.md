# **Decision Tree Induction Algorithm**

A **decision tree** is a flowchart-like tree structure where:

* Each **internal node** denotes a test on an attribute.
* Each **branch** represents an outcome of the test.
* Each **leaf node** (terminal node) holds a class label.
* The **topmost node** in a tree is the **root node**.

## **Basic Algorithm**

The decision tree induction algorithm generates the tree in a **recursive, top-down, divide-and-conquer** manner.

1. **Start** with all the training examples at the root node.
2. **Select the best attribute** to split the data based on an **attribute selection measure**.
3. **Create branches** for each outcome of the test on the attribute.
4. **Partition the dataset** accordingly and assign the subsets to the branches.
5. **Repeat** the process recursively for each branch until:

   - All samples in the node belong to the same class.
   - There are no remaining attributes for further partitioning.
   - There are no more samples.

## **Attribute Selection Measures**

Choosing the correct attribute at each step is critical for building an effective decision tree.

- **Information Gain (ID3 Algorithm)**
  Measures the expected reduction in entropy after a split. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen.

- **Gain Ratio (C4.5 Algorithm)**
  Adjusts the information gain by considering the intrinsic information of a split to avoid bias toward attributes with many outcomes.

- **Gini Index (CART Algorithm)**
  Measures impurity of a dataset. The attribute with the lowest Gini index after the split is chosen.

## **Tree Pruning**

Without pruning, decision trees can become overly complex and overfit the data.

- **Prepruning (Early Stopping)**
  Halts the growth of the tree early based on a stopping condition (e.g., minimum number of samples in a node).

- **Postpruning**
  Builds the full tree and then removes branches that have little statistical significance or predictive power.

Pruning increases the ability of the model to generalize to unseen data.

## **Representation and Rule Extraction**

- Each **internal node**: a condition or test on an attribute.
- Each **branch**: result of the test.
- Each **leaf**: a class label.

**Decision rules** can be extracted by tracing paths from the root to the leaf nodes, combining all conditions along the path.

## **Advantages**

- Easy to understand, visualize, and interpret.
- Works with both categorical and numerical attributes.
- Minimal data preparation is needed.
- Can handle multi-output problems.

## **Disadvantages**

- Prone to overfitting, especially with small datasets.
- Small changes in data can result in different splits (instability).
- Greedy algorithms (like ID3, C4.5) do not guarantee an optimal tree.
