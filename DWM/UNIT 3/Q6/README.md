## **Holdout and Random Subsampling Method for Evaluating a Classifier**

### **Holdout Method**

* In **holdout method**, the available dataset is **randomly divided** into **two disjoint subsets**:

  1. **Training data set** – used to train the classifier.
  2. **Testing (or test) data set** – used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

* A common division is to use **2/3 of the data for training** and **1/3 of the data for testing**.
  This ensures that there is sufficient data for both model construction and for assessing its performance on unseen data.

* **Process**:

  * The classifier is trained using the training set.
  * Once the classifier is constructed, the test set is used to estimate the **error rate** of the classifier.
  * The error rate is calculated as the proportion of misclassified instances in the test data.

**Advantages**:

- Very **simple** to implement.
- Computationally **efficient** as the model is trained and tested only once.

---

**Problems / Disadvantages**:

- If the training set is large, the classifier is likely to perform better due to more data being available during training. However, fewer examples will be available for testing, which can make the accuracy estimate less reliable.
- If the test set is large, the error estimate will be more accurate, but the classifier might perform worse due to having less data for training.
- The samples might not be **representative**. For example, some classes may have very few or no instances at all in either the training or the test set.

---

**Solution**:

- **Stratification** is the method used to ensure that both the training and the testing sets have **approximately the same proportion of examples from each class** as in the original dataset.
  This improves representativeness and produces a more accurate evaluation.

### **Random Subsampling Method**

- **Random subsampling** is a **variation** of the holdout method.

- In this method:

  - The holdout process is repeated **k times**.
  - In each repetition, the dataset is randomly split into training and test sets.
  - A fixed number of examples are selected **without replacement** for each split.

- For **each data split**:

  - The classifier is trained from scratch using the training examples.
  - The performance measure $E_i$ (accuracy, error rate, etc.) is computed on the test set.

- The **overall accuracy** is obtained by taking the **average** of the accuracies from all $k$ iterations:

$$
E = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K E_i
$$

Where:

- $K$ = number of iterations (experiments)
- $E_i$ = accuracy obtained in the $i^{th}$ experiment

---

**Advantages**:

- Reduces dependency on a single arbitrary split of the data.
- Produces a more **reliable and stable** accuracy estimate compared to the basic holdout method.

---

**Disadvantages**:

- Requires retraining the classifier multiple times, increasing **computational cost**.
- Without stratification, there is still a possibility of having non-representative samples.
