Study of CSS Cascading
Cascading in CSS refers to the way browsers determine which CSS rules are applied to an element when multiple rules target the same property. The word “cascading” means that styles flow together from different sources into a final computed style.
The priority is determined by the Cascading Order, which follows these principles:

Importance – Rules with !important take the highest priority.
Specificity – More specific selectors (e.g., #id selectors) override less specific ones (e.g., tag selectors).
Source Order – If specificity is the same, the rule that appears last in the CSS is applied.
Inheritance – Some CSS properties automatically inherit values from their parent elements.
This ensures consistent and predictable styling even when styles come from multiple sources such as external CSS files, internal style blocks, or inline styles.
