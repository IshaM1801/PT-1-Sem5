Differentiate Between Different Internet Protocols

In the context of networked communication, a protocol is a detailed specification of how communication between two computers will be carried out in order to serve some purpose. A protocol defines both the high-level behavior of the software that implements it and the low-level details such as the specific fields in a communication message, the order in which these fields appear, the number of bits in each field, and how these bits are to be interpreted.

The Internet makes use of a collection of such protocols, each with its own function, but all working together to deliver data from one system to another across a global, open communications network. These protocols differ in their scope, features, and reliability. The most fundamental among them are IP, TCP, and UDP, which serve as the backbone for a range of higher-level protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Telnet, and DNS.

1. Internet Protocol (IP)

The Internet Protocol is responsible for delivering packets of data from a source computer to a destination computer identified by an IP address. An IP address is a 32-bit number, normally written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (for example, 192.0.34.166). When an application wants to send information, the IP software packages the data into a packet containing the source and destination addresses, length of the data, and other header information. If the destination is on the same local network, the packet is sent directly; otherwise, it is sent through one or more gateways until it reaches the destination. IP includes an error detection checksum but does not guarantee delivery, making it an unreliable, connectionless protocol.

2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP operates on top of IP and adds reliability through the concept of a connection. Before data is exchanged, TCP establishes a full-duplex connection between two computers by means of a three-way handshake. Every packet sent is acknowledged; if an acknowledgment is not received before a timer expires, the packet is retransmitted. TCP also introduces the idea of ports, which allows multiple applications on a single host to communicate independently. Certain well-known applications use specific port numbers (e.g., SMTP on port 25). TCP is thus a connection-oriented, reliable protocol.

3. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP is an alternative to TCP that also works above IP but does not establish a connection or guarantee delivery. It retains the port concept but eliminates acknowledgments and retransmissions, resulting in much faster communication for simple tasks. UDP is often used in situations where small, quick exchanges are needed, and occasional loss can be tolerated. For example, DNS commonly uses UDP because a name resolution request and reply can be exchanged in just two messages.

4. Domain Name System (DNS)

Although not a transport protocol like TCP or UDP, DNS is an important Internet service. It translates human-readable host names (e.g., www.example.org) into IP addresses and can also perform the reverse mapping. DNS typically uses UDP on port 53 for efficiency, but TCP may be used for larger data transfers. DNS servers are distributed worldwide, and together they form the “phonebook” of the Internet.

5. Higher-Level Protocols

On top of TCP or UDP, various application protocols provide specialized services:
• HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – The primary protocol for communication between web browsers and servers; built on TCP for reliability.
• FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Enables file transfer between machines; uses TCP for reliable delivery.
• SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – Used to send email between servers; also TCP-based.
• Telnet – Allows a user to log in to and execute commands on a remote machine as though physically present; runs over TCP.

## Comparison Table

Summary

The Internet is built upon a suite of protocols, each playing a distinct role. IP handles addressing and routing, TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery, UDP offers faster but less reliable communication, and application protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, and Telnet provide specialized services. Understanding the differences among these protocols is essential for comprehending how the Internet functions as an interconnected system.
