Document Object Model (DOM) for HTML Code

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a tree structure where each node is an object representing part of the document. This structure allows programs, such as JavaScript, to manipulate the document’s content, structure, and style dynamically.

In an HTML document:
• Document → The root of the DOM tree, representing the entire web page.
• Elements → HTML tags like <p>, <div>, <h1> are represented as element nodes.
• Attributes → Properties of elements, such as id, class, src, are attribute nodes.
• Text → The actual text inside elements is represented as text nodes.

The DOM is platform- and language-independent. Any changes made to the DOM using JavaScript are immediately reflected in the browser without reloading the page.

Example HTML Code and DOM Representation

HTML Code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

DOM Tree:
Document
└── html
├── head
│ └── title → “My Page”
└── body
├── h1 → “Hello World”
└── p → “This is a paragraph.”

In JavaScript, we can access and change elements in the DOM:
document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "New Heading";

DOM History and Levels
• Netscape 2.0 → Introduced a simple DOM with the write() method for adding content, and access to form controls and anchors, but images could not be modified.
• Netscape 3.0 → Added the ability to modify images, enabling interactive effects. Internet Explorer 3.0 had a similar model.
• Netscape 4.0 & IE 4.0 → Allowed access to the entire document and style information, but with incompatible implementations.

To standardize the DOM, the W3C began formal work in August 1997 and released: 1. DOM Level 1 (1998) – Two modules: Core (for any XML document) and HTML (for HTML documents). 2. DOM Level 2 – Added Events and Style modules, extended Level 1 functionality, and in some ways replaced Level 1 HTML. 3. DOM Level 3 – Still evolving, with more features for XML processing.

Generalization of the DOM

The W3C DOM is not limited to HTML in browsers. It also applies to XML documents and can be used in standalone applications written in languages like Java. While this generality adds complexity, in web development, DOM is mostly used for HTML documents accessed via JavaScript in browsers.

Conclusion

The DOM is essential for creating interactive, dynamic web pages. It provides a structured representation of HTML as an object tree and allows scripts to read, modify, and react to user actions. Using methods like getElementById() and querySelector(), developers can change content, style, and attributes instantly, improving user experience without reloading the page.
