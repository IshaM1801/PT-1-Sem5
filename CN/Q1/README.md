# **Q1. Explain what is a Computer Network. Explain its Applications.**

## **Computer Network**

A **computer network** is a group of computers/devices (**nodes**) that use a set of common **communication protocols** over **digital interconnections** (**links**) in a **topology** for the purpose of **sharing resources** located on or provided by the network nodes.

These interconnections may be established using **wired media** such as _Ethernet cables_ or **wireless technologies** like _Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,_ or _cellular networks_.

### **Classification based on Geographical Coverage**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – limited to a small area such as an office or home.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – spans across a city or campus.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – covers a large area; the Internet is the largest example.

Networking enables devices to **exchange data** and **share resources** efficiently, forming the backbone of **communication** and **data transfer** in modern society.

## **Applications of Computer Networks**

### **1. Access to Information**

Computer networks allow users to access vast amounts of data from **remote servers**, **databases**, and **online platforms** in real time.
This removes the need for **physical transfer** of files and makes information available globally.

### **5. The Internet of Things (IoT)**

IoT connects **smart devices** and **sensors** that communicate with each other to collect and share data, often with minimal human involvement.

**Examples:** Smart home devices (_Alexa, Google Home_), wearable health trackers, connected vehicles.

IoT networks improve **automation**, **energy efficiency**, and **user convenience**.

---

## **Need of Networking**

- Access to remote programs
- Access to remote databases
- Communication media

---

## **Goals of Computer Networks**

- **Resource Sharing**
- **High Reliability**
- **Scalability**
