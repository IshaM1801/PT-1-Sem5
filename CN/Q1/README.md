Q1. Explain what is a computer network. Explain its applications.
Computer Network

A computer network is a group of computers/devices (nodes) that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections (links) in a topology for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.
These interconnections may be established using wired media such as Ethernet cables or wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.

Computer networks can be classified based on their geographical coverage:
• LAN (Local Area Network) – limited to a small area such as an office or home.
• MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – spans across a city or campus.
• WAN (Wide Area Network) – covers a large area; the internet is the largest example.

Networking enables devices to exchange data and share resources efficiently, forming the backbone of communication and data transfer in modern society.

Applications of Computer Networks 1. Access to Information

Computer networks allow users to access vast amounts of data from remote servers, databases, and online platforms in real time. This removes the need for physical transfer of files and makes information available globally.

    •	Example: Students retrieving e-books from online libraries, researchers downloading datasets, or employees accessing documents from cloud storage.

This application has transformed education, research, and corporate decision-making.

    2.	Person-to-Person Communication

Networks make it possible for individuals to communicate instantly, regardless of distance. Communication can be real-time (e.g., voice/video calls, instant messaging) or delayed (e.g., emails, recorded messages).
• Examples: Zoom or Microsoft Teams for meetings, WhatsApp for messaging, Gmail for emails.
Networking reduces communication costs, improves collaboration, and supports both personal and professional interaction.

    3.	Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce)

Computer networks provide the foundation for buying and selling goods and services online. E-commerce platforms allow secure transactions, order tracking, and online payments.
• Examples: Amazon, Flipkart, PayPal, online banking.
This has made shopping convenient, expanded markets globally, and enabled businesses to operate 24/7.

    4.	Entertainment

Networking supports streaming services, online gaming, and digital content sharing. Users can enjoy movies, music, games, and live broadcasts from anywhere in the world.
• Examples: Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, multiplayer online games like PUBG or Fortnite.
High-speed networks have made entertainment more interactive, on-demand, and accessible.

    5.	The Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT connects smart devices and sensors that communicate with each other to collect and share data, often with minimal human involvement.
• Examples: Smart home devices (Alexa, Google Home), wearable health trackers, connected vehicles.
IoT networks improve automation, energy efficiency, and user convenience.
