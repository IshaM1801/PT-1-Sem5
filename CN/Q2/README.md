LAN (Local Area Network) 1. A LAN is a private network that operates within and nearby a single building such as a home, office, or factory. 2. Widely used to connect personal computers and consumer electronics to share resources (e.g., printers) and exchange information. 3. Wireless LANs:
• Gained popularity in homes, offices, cafeterias.
• Avoid installing cables where cost is high.
• Each computer has a radio modem and an antenna to communicate.
• Usually connects to an AP (Access Point), wireless router, or base station.
• AP relays packets between wireless computers and the Internet.
• Mesh network configurations can relay packets via multiple devices. 4. Wired LANs:
• Use copper cable, coaxial cable, or optical fiber.
• Speeds range from 100 Mbps to 40 Gbps.
• Most common type is Ethernet in a switched Ethernet topology.
• Each computer connects to a switch that relays packets to the right destination. 5. Popular Standard: IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) – speeds from 11 Mbps (802.11b) to 7 Gbps (802.11ad).

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) 1. Covers a city. 2. Best-known example – cable television network. 3. Grew from early ad hoc systems:
• Antenna placed on a hill.
• Signal piped to subscribers’ houses. 4. Later developments:
• Entire cities wired with coaxial cable carrying TV programs and content.
• Initially only for TV reception.
• In the late 1990s, unused parts of spectrum used for Internet access. 5. Cable MAN structure:
• Centralized cable head-end receives signals from Internet and other sources.
• Distributed to junction boxes and homes. 6. Wireless MANs:
• Example: IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX).
• Has not seen wide adoption.

WAN (Wide Area Network) 1. Spans a large geographical area – country, continent, or multiple continents. 2. Can be a private organization WAN (enterprise) or a commercial service (transit network). 3. Example: connects offices in different cities. 4. Hosts:
• Computers running user programs. 5. Communication Subnet:
• Rest of the network connecting hosts.
• Carries messages from host to host. 6. Subnet consists of:
• Transmission lines – move bits between machines.
• Switching elements (switches/routers) – connect transmission lines. 7. Routers:
• Choose outgoing line when data arrives.
• Use routing algorithms to pick the path.
• Use forwarding algorithms to send packets to next destination. 8. WANs may have many transmission lines and intermediate routers to forward data over long distances.
