## **LAN (Local Area Network)**

- A LAN is a private network that operates within and nearby a single building such as a home, office, or factory.
- Widely used to connect personal computers and consumer electronics to share resources (e.g., printers) and exchange information.

### **Wireless LANs**

- Gained popularity in homes, offices, cafeterias.
- Avoid installing cables where cost is high.
- Each computer has a radio modem and an antenna to communicate.
- Usually connects to an AP (Access Point), wireless router, or base station.
- AP relays packets between wireless computers and the Internet.
- Mesh network configurations can relay packets via multiple devices.

### **Wired LANs**

- Use copper cable, coaxial cable, or optical fiber.
- Speeds range from 100 Mbps to 40 Gbps.
- Most common type is Ethernet in a switched Ethernet topology.
- Each computer connects to a switch that relays packets to the right destination.

**Popular Standard:**

- IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) â€“ speeds from 11 Mbps (802.11b) to 7 Gbps (802.11ad).

## **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**

- Covers a city.
- Best-known example â€“ cable television network.

**Grew from early ad hoc systems:**

- Antenna placed on a hill.
- Signal piped to subscribersâ€™ houses.

**Later developments:**

- Entire cities wired with coaxial cable carrying TV programs and content.
- Initially only for TV reception.
- In the late 1990s, unused parts of spectrum used for Internet access.

**Cable MAN structure:**

- Centralized cable head-end receives signals from Internet and other sources.
- Distributed to junction boxes and homes.

**Wireless MANs:**

- Example: IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX).
- Has not seen wide adoption.

## **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

- Spans a large geographical area â€“ country, continent, or multiple continents.
- Can be a private organization WAN (enterprise) or a commercial service (transit network).
- Example: connects offices in different cities.

**Hosts:**

- Computers running user programs.

**Communication Subnet:**

- Rest of the network connecting hosts.
- Carries messages from host to host.

**Subnet consists of:**

- Transmission lines â€“ move bits between machines.
- Switching elements (switches/routers) â€“ connect transmission lines.

**Routers:**

- Choose outgoing line when data arrives.
- Use routing algorithms to pick the path.
- Use forwarding algorithms to send packets to next destination.
- WANs may have many transmission lines and intermediate routers to forward data over long distances.
