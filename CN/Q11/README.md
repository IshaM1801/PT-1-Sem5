1. Twisted-Pair Cable
   Two copper conductors, each with plastic insulation.
   Wires twisted around each other to reduce noise effect.
   One wire carries electrical signal, the other is ground.
   Commonly installed in building telephone wiring.
   Twisting ensures each wire is equally exposed to noise.
   Cost-effective, easy to install and maintain.
   Types:
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
   4 pairs (8 wires) of insulated copper wires (~1 mm thick).
   Wires twisted in a helical form.
   Flexible and cheap.
   CAT 3, CAT 4, CAT 5, Enhanced CAT 5, CAT 6.
   CAT 3 → telephone connections.
   CAT 4, CAT 5 → Ethernet.
   CAT 5e, CAT 6 → Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps), Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps).
   No additional shielding → more prone to interference than STP.
   Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
   Metal foil or braided-mesh covering.
   Prevents electromagnetic noise penetration.
   More expensive than UTP.
   Less susceptible to noise → better performance in noisy environments.
2. Coaxial Cable
   Copper core surrounded by heavy shielding.
   Connects computers in a network, used in cable TV and broadband.
   Outer conductor shields inner conductor from stray signals.
   High bandwidth but lossy → requires repeater for long distances.
   Needs coaxial connectors.
   Most common connector: BNC (Bayone-Neill-Concelman).
   More durable than twisted pair, but heavier and less flexible.
3. Fiber Optic Cable
   Made of glass.
   Transmits signals in the form of light.
   Light pulse = 1-bit, no pulse = 0-bit.
   Immune to electromagnetic interference.
   Extremely high bandwidth → supports very high speeds over long distances.
   Optical transmission components:
   Transmission media: ultra-thin glass fiber.
   Light source: LED or laser diode (emits light pulses when current applied).
   Detector: photodiode (generates electric pulse when light falls on it).
   Working:
   LED/laser at one end converts electrical signal to light pulses.
   Light pulses travel through fiber.
   Photodiode at receiving end reconverts light pulses to electrical signal.
   Structure:
   Core: one or several glass fibers.
   Cladding: surrounding layer.
   Types:
   Single-mode fiber: single path, laser source, long-distance communication.
   Multimode fiber: multiple paths, LED source, short-distance high-speed links.
   Drawback:
   Acceptable for short distance.
   Expensive for long distance.
   Fiber optic installation requires specialized equipment.
